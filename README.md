This repo cointains the collected macroeconomic data as well as the notebooks and documentation for replicating the models described in the paper. 

The data collection, cleaning, and feature engineering notebooks can be found for the [training period (2005-2010)](data_collection_engineering.ipynb) as well as the [testing period(2020-2023)](data_period2_engineering.ipynb).

The CSVs output into the main directory represent the datasets used for training, testing, and the demo used in the paper.

[Macroeconomic Data](Macroeconomic_Data) was downloaded from the St. Louis FRED for the correponding periods.

Feature descriptions can be found in the data tables as well as the notebooks.

The training and model selection notebook can be found [here](training.ipynb), and the feature selection notebook is linked [here](feature_selection.ipynb).
